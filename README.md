# Snapper

1:1 HTML to PDF Conversion Utility for *[Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society](https://www.coursera.org/course/design)* MOOC Students

## Wait.. what? when? why?
Snapper is a web-app ideated, designed, prototyped and full-stack implemented in a roughtly 10 days *pressure cooker* by one of the CTAs in the Staff team assigned to the 6th session of the above MOOC, after having been selected amongst the best performant students from the previous run of the same course.

The goal of the app is to let the students have a platform to take 1-minute snapshots of their website projects' pages (containing their assignments for the week) and link/attach them in the peer-review platform.

### Tha gap
The main gap was the lack of a cross-platform app to accomplish such a task without messing up with tutorials, messy pdf conversions, browser extensions, infinite frustration.. and so on.

**For a complete presentation of the work and the rationales behind have a look at [this keynote](http://your.github.io/store/snapper_keynote/).**

## Current status
The app was positively evaluated and tested by some of the staff members, who also contributed with ideas and possible future improvements. Since it was presented a few time before the end of the session, it was never put in beta testing with the actual students. Currently, the session is over, and if the course will keep its structure in the following runs there is a chance this app could be actually put in production.

If not, it will stay here as a reference. :)

## Thanks to..
* All the staff members of the course (especially Jin Ah, Jos√©, Cristina, Virignie and Maura!) for the precious experience we had together during 7 weeks of ups and lows with thousands of students from all over the worlds and their incredible projects
* Coursera for exposing their APIs and for their milestone work
* Prof. Karl. T. Ulrich for the course and [the Bell-V ice cream scoop](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/ice-cream-scoop/)
